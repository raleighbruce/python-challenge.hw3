# Python Challenge

This particular challenge has will cover what we have learned about importing csv data and with our knowledge of lists, loops, and conditional statements we will be able to break down and analyze the csv data for two projects:

    1) PyBank

    2) PyPoll

PyBank
-------------------------

In this project we have been given ficticious financial records. Our job is to take those records and analyze the csv data to produce the following:

    1) Total number of months

    2) Total sum of months

    2) Average change of the profit/loss per month

    3) Greatest overall increase in profit with associated month

    4) Greatest overall loss in profit with associated month


To achieve this we must produce a code that will update a list of monthly changes in profit, track the month with the change in a separate list, add the total number months, and finally sum the profit/loss column for our total. 

Once we are able to produce our lists we can use simple functions to get the min/max/average and index the month of the min and max. 

Our findings should align with this data:

Financial Analysis
--------------------------
Total Months: 86
--------------------------
Total: $22564198
--------------------------
Average Change: $-8311.11
--------------------------
Greatest Increase In Profits Aug-16 ($1862002)
--------------------------
Greatest Decrease In Profits Feb-14 ($-1825558)
-------------------------

After we are able to succesfully run our code we need to export our data to a .txt file in an analysis folder for review. 



PyPoll
-------------------------

In this project we have been given ficticious election poll data. Our job is to take those records and analyze the csv data to produce the following:

    1) Total number of votes

    2) List of candidates with the following data:

        a) Percentage of votes for indvidual candidate

        b) Total votes for individual candidate

    2) Election winner
    

To achieve this we must produce a code that will update a list of candidates. From this list we can count the number of votes per candidate and update findings to a separate list. We can then calculate the percentage of votes and max votes per candidate to determine the winner.

Our findings should align with this data:

Election Results
------------------------
Total Votes: 369711
------------------------
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
------------------------
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
------------------------
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette
------------------------

After we are able to succesfully run our code we need to export our data to a .txt file in an analysis folder for review.
